      <p>
        I am a Telematics Engineer with over eight years of experience
        developing web applications using Javascript/Typescript, Java, and C#. I
        mainly developed applications using nodejs with frameworks like
        expressjs and nestjs as the backend and react/redux and svelte as the
        front end. I also worked with IBM Cloud technologies such as Event
        Streams, which is based on Kafka, and NoSQL databases. My strengths are
        problem-solving, technology, communication, fast learner, and personal
        development.
